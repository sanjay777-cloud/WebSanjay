	<p style="color:white;">
			 Welcome to you in my personal web world. Iâ€™m a professsional teacher living in Nepal ( Harinagar Rural Municipality - 01, Sunsari) whose teaching methodoly means alot. I define myself as an <strong> educator, tutor and alos a programmer. </strong> My teaching journey is my way of participating in the world, fusing transmitting ideas and concepts with personal intimate experiences to build connections with others and understand and reclaim my own reality. Through understanding as well as my teaching experience , and clear visual language my work captures the collective human experience and reveals its universality through personal narrative exploration.

			<h1 style="text-align:center;"> A BIT OF MY STORY</h1>
			<h3> How it all began</h3> 
	<dd>

		<p style="color:white;">
				I grew up with a curious, restless and observant spirit in a home where <strong> <em> </p>
		<p style="color:black;"> I have been inspired by my dearest & very respected father (Balram Poddar).</em> </strong> </p>
 <p style="color:white;">
			 Having always been captivated by the power of teaching as an expression of personality, I begun my jurney to learn about the world of Education system. After finishing my university studies, I spent 3 years in <strong> Japan </strong>  immersed in the field of <strong> Information Technology,</strong> until my thirst for finding other ways to live life flew me the the other side of the world to teach <strong> Korean Language </strong> at <strong> <em>Inaruwa. </em> </strong> I take every opportunity along this path of discovery through various lands to continue to ponder and wonder  through my teaching practice which, like life itself, becomes deeper and fuller every day.</p> 




			<div class ="row Side">
			<h1 style="text-align:center;"> My Statement </h1>
<dd>
	<p style="color:white;">
			 My teaching practice is a journey of self-definition. Through an organic and physical language classess, I am constantly adding up to a collection of new ideas and impliment it in each life event and experience leaves behind throughout this eternal process of becoming who I am. My teaching methodology is the lens through which I interpret in reality.

		<p style="color:white;"> 
			My way of teaching in group of students are my link to the world and my way of participating in it. By transmitting the concepts with personal intimate experiences and translating them into a clear and accessible visual language, I strive to build connections with others that help me understand and reclaim my own reality. </p>
